Internal Working Of Java Try Catch Block

-> JVM checks whether exception is handled or not. If exception is not handled, JVM provides a default
exception  handler that perform following task:

1. Print exception description
2. Print stack trace (Heriarchy of methods where handleds)
3. Cause program to terminate.

-> If exception is handled by the application programmer, normal flow of the application is maintained. 
i.e reset code will execute
