Collections in Java

1. The Collection in Java is a framework that provides an architecture to store 
and manipulate the group of objects.

2. Java Collections can achieve all the operations that you perform on a data such as 
searching, sorting, insertion, manipulation, and deletion.

3. Java Collection means a single unit of objects. 
Java Collection framework provides many interfaces (Set, List, Queue, Deque) 
and classes (ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList, PriorityQueue, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet).

4. What is Collection in Java
A Collection represents a single unit of objects, i.e., a group.

5. The java.util package contains all the classes and interfaces for the Collection framework

6. Iterator interface

Iterator interface provides the facility of iterating the elements in a forward direction only.

Methods of Iterator interface
There are only three methods in the Iterator interface. They are:

No.	Method	Description
1	public boolean hasNext()	It returns true if the iterator has more elements otherwise it returns false.
2	public Object next()	It returns the element and moves the cursor pointer to the next element.
3	public void remove()	It removes the last elements returned by the iterator. It is less used.

7. Iterable Interface
The Iterable interface is the root interface for all the collection classes. The Collection interface extends the Iterable interface and therefore all the subclasses of Collection interface also implement the Iterable interface.

It contains only one abstract method. i.e.,

Iterator<T> iterator()  
It returns the iterator over the elements of type T.

8. Collection Interface
The Collection interface is the interface which is implemented by all the classes in the collection framework. 
It declares the methods that every collection will have. 
In other words, we can say that the Collection interface builds the foundation on which the collection framework depends.

Some of the methods of Collection interface are Boolean add ( Object obj), Boolean addAll ( Collection c), void clear(), etc. which are implemented by all the subclasses of Collection interface.

9. List Interface
List interface is the child interface of Collection interface. It inhibits a list type data structure in which we can store the ordered collection of objects. It can have duplicate values.

List interface is implemented by the classes ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, and Stack.

To instantiate the List interface, we must use :

List <data-type> list1= new ArrayList();  
List <data-type> list2 = new LinkedList();  
List <data-type> list3 = new Vector();  
List <data-type> list4 = new Stack();
