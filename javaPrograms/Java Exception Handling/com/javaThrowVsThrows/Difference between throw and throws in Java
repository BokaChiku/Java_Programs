Difference between throw and throws in Java

1. throw

-> Java throw keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception.

-> Checked exception cannot be propagated using throw only.

-> Throw is followed by an instance.

-> Throw is used within the method.

-> You cannot throw multiple exceptions.


Java throw example
void m(){  
throw new ArithmeticException("sorry");  
}  

2. throws

-> Java throws keyword is used to declare an exception.

-> Checked exception can be propagated with throws.

-> Throws is followed by class.

-> Throws is used with the method signature.

-> You can declare multiple exceptions e.g. public void method()throws IOException,SQLException.

Java throws example
void m()throws ArithmeticException{  
//method code  
}
