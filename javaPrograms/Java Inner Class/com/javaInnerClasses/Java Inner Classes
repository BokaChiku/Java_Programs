Java Inner Classes

-> Java inner class or nested class is a class which is declared inside the class or interface.

-> We use inner classes to logically group classes and interfaces in one place so that it can be more readable and maintainable.

-> Additionally, it can access all the members of outer class including private data members and methods.

-> Syntax of Inner class

class Java_Outer_class
{  
  //code  
 class Java_Inner_class
 {  
   //code  
 }  
} 

-> Advantage of java inner classes

1. Nested classes represent a special type of relationship that is it can access all the members 
(data members and methods) of outer class including private. 

2. Nested classes are used to develop more readable and 
maintainable code because it logically group classes and interfaces in one place only.

3. Code Optimization: It requires less code to write.

-> Difference between nested class and inner class in Java

1. Inner class is a part of nested class. Non-static nested classes are known as inner classes.


-> Types of Nested classes

1. There are two types of nested classes non-static and static nested classes.
The non-static nested classes are also known as inner classes.

-> Non-static nested class (inner class)
1. Member inner class
2. Anonymous inner class
3. Local inner class

-> Static nested class
